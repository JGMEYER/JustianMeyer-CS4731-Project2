AI VERSION 0.2
If the home planets start within 10 steps of each other, perform a variation of
minimax to prevent rage attacks. Minimax ends once the player gains more
resources then the opponent. After "rage defense" ends, perform AI Version 0.1
for the remainder of the matchup, instead scoring by total ships on fleets and
planets as opposed to just total ships on planets.
